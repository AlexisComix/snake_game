# snake_game
By AlexisComix

## Foreword
This is just a snake game copy I made in pygame over a few 
hours over a couple of days. This was mostly just so I could
learn git and GitHub, and I never expected to get this far with 
a fully working game that I am quite proud of.

## Prerequisites

With that waffle out of the way, I must inform you that this 
project uses the pygame library with python 3.10.x. To run
this, you will need to install pygame using pip on the command
line and be using a python version 3.10.x. Any other python version
means full functionality and performance is not guaranteed, but 
pygame **is** needed either way.
